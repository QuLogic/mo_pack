mo_pack can be installed using conda, or from the sourcecode in the download.


Using conda
-----------
mo_pack is available from the conda channel "scitools".

Builds are provided for the following platforms:
 * Linux 64-bit,
 * Mac OSX 64-bit
and for various different release versions of Python and numpy.

Once conda is installed, use the following command to install mo_pack:
  conda install -c scitools mo_pack
This will *also* install libmo_unpack, as a required dependency.

To install using conda, you must first download and install conda,
for example from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html.
Further documentation on using conda and the features it provides can be found
at http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html.


Installing from source
----------------------
The wrapped library, "libmo_unpack", must be installed first.
See :  https://github.com/SciTools/libmo_unpack.

The basic build requirement is to run : "python2.7 setup.py build_ext"
The higher-level "build" or "install" commands will also invoke this.

The 'build_ext' step requires you to specify the correct paths to the
headers, build-time and run-time location of the libmo_unpack shared library.
This will look something like:
  $ python setup.py build_ext -I<includes> -L<lib-for-build> -R<lib-for-runtime>
